# BM08-XAFS-XRF-Beamline-Simulation-OASYS-
OASYS simulation setup for BM08-XAFS/XRF beamline at SESAME synchrotron, including optical layout, ray-tracing, and energy resolution studies.

This repository contains the OASYS simulation workflow for the BM08-XAFS/XRF beamline at SESAME. The simulation was developed to model and optimize the beamline optics and performance.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
BM08-XAFS_XRF.ows â€“ OASYS workflow file containing the beamline simulation setup.

ðŸ›  Requirements
To run the simulation, you need:

OASYS1 â€“ Open Source Synchrotron Simulation Environment
Installation guide: https://github.com/oasys-kit/OASYS1

Required OASYS add-on packages:

Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW)

ShadowOui (for ray tracing)

XOPPY (for X-ray optics components)

You can install these from the OASYS Add-on Manager.

â–¶ How to Open the Simulation
Install OASYS and required add-ons.

Download this repository or clone it:




git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/BM08-XAFS_XRF-Simulation.git
Open OASYS.

Go to File â†’ Open, then select the .ows file from this repository.


Run the simulation by clicking Run in OASYS.


ðŸ“„ Notes
This simulation represents the BM08-XAFS/XRF beamline layout with realistic parameters.

It can be modified to test different optical configurations, source parameters, or energy ranges.

Designed for academic and research purposes.
